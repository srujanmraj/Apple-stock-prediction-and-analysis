Time-Series Forecasting-Apple Stock Price Using Prophet
Project Overview
Comparison between Time Series Analysis Vs Fundamental Analysis for Apple Inc. Time Series Analysis uses historical patterns, seasonality to predict the future values by developing mathematical models that capture the series. We used Seasonal Auto-Regressive Moving Average(SARIMA) & Prophet for Time Series Forecasting.

Fundamental Analysis is established on foundations of economics,financial reports and researching several business/industry aspects. We take a look at financial ratios, balance sheets,domestic & global business environments,etc. At the end we arrive at conclusion of whether the security is undervalued or overvalued. We used Intrinsic Valuation in our case.
